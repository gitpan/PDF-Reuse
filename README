PDF/Reuse version 0.23
======================

This module gives you a possibility to reuse PDF-files. You can use pages,
images, fonts and Acrobat JavaScript from old PDF-files (if they
were not encrypted), and rearrange the components, and add new graphics,
texts etc.

There is also support for graphics. In the tutorial there is a description of
how to transform a simple PDF-pages to graphic perl objects with the help of
programs based on this module.

The module is fairly fast, so it should be possible to used it for mass
production. 

Usage e.g. for a long list:

   use PDF::Reuse;
   use strict;

   # Getting customer data in some way ...

   my @custData = ( { firstName => 'Anders',
                      lastName  => 'Wallberg' },
                    { firstName => 'Nils',
                      lastName  => 'Versen' },
                    { firstName => 'Niclas',
                      lastName  => 'Lindberg' },
             
                    # and 10000 more records

                    { firstName => 'Sten',
                      lastName  => 'Wernlund' } );

   prFile('myFile.pdf');

   for my $customer (@custData)
   {    prForm('letter.pdf');
        prText(50, 750, "Dear $customer->{'firstName'}");
        # ...
        prPage();
   }
   prEnd();



INSTALLATION

To install this module in a Windows environment:
   
   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake
   nmake test
   nmake install

(If you haven't got nmake, try to download it via
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/Nmake15.exe)


Under other operating systems try the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


N.B.
In the examples directory there is a zipfile with PDF documents and generated
modules. Unzip it. I had to put all these files like that, to hide them from
the normal processing around the upload to CPAN.
