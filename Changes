   - Corrected an error that occured when a form was used many times in different
     documents. (Translation of old => new object number)

     Tried to make the module backwards compatible with Perl 5.6.1
     Changed use 5.008 to use 5.006, constants are individually defined and
     AutoLoader is used instead of SelfLoader.
